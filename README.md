OSM Utils
=============

After writing classes to encapsulate Nodes, Ways, Relations, etc once and
figuring I would just include *that* codebase over and over again I eventually
rewrote them for another project so that I could keep things portable and
uncluttered.  Since that second project was supposed to be clean and uncluttered
I thought I would just include that project.  That was simple the same way my
Quantum Mechanics class was simple in college.. The first week makes sense but
you spend the next 12 weeks trying to make sure your brain doesn't explode.
This is nothing but Java classes for the OSM types.
